# nginx-conf

We open source our NGINX conf. You can help us improve our service by contributing the conf. Also, we welcome you can build your own FastGit.

## Filename rule

[site_url].conf

## Quick install

Caution, till now, quick install **only supports Debian 10**.

You can also take a try if you want to deploy FastGit on any system which uses APT as its package management tool (e.g., Ubuntu).
But we have no guarantee that the script will work properly.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FastGitORG/nginx-conf/master/install-debian10.sh
sudo bash install-debian10.sh
```
